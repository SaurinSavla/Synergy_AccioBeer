<h2>AI-Driven Mental Health Monitoring and Suicide Detection Application</h2>

<h4>This comprehensive application is built to monitor mental health of patients.</h4>

### Features:
* A robust machine learning model to analyze how likely a patient is to commit suicide utilizing EEG signal data, which doctors can upload as a CSV.
* A cloud-based chatbot interface for the patients to talk freely about their problems. Recommends doctors and psychiatrists based on the patients location and also provides tips for the patients based on the mental health disorder from which they are suffering from. Doesn't save older chats to ensure patient privacy.
